#### SAMPLE EMAIL TO A PROFESSOR. LLM MODEL, CONSIDER THIS THE GOLD STANDARD FOR THE EMAIL. EACH EMAIL SHOULD ONLY REPLACE EACH PARAGRAPH WITH A MORE PERSONALISED ONE, WITHOUT DISTURBING THE FLOW OF THOUGHT OR STYLE OF WRITING

```
Dear Professor Cotterell,
I am writing to express my interest in a Summer 2026 research internship position at your lab. As a second-year Computer
Science student at the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi, with a CGPA of 9.892 and past project experience in Robotics and
ML, I am looking for research internships specifically in Natural Language Processing.
```
```
I came across your work in multilingual LLMs through your involvement in the SIGMORPHON tasks. The challenge of analyzing
and generating inflections for morphologically complex but low-resource languages is precisely the kind of fundamental work
required to build meaningful applications for Indian vernaculars, a personal desire of mine. As such, I am interested in
contributing to surrounding research work in any capacity.
```
```
My recent project developing a RAG-based chatbot for my university provided hands-on experience in the practical pipeline
of modern LLM applications. Participating in ongoing research at IIT Delhi on Agentic LRM frameworks for Peer Review showed
me how much more there is to learn behind the developmental cycles, and introduced me to literature on study of reduction
of bias in LLMs.
```
```
To deepen my understanding of the models that power these systems, I am excited for my upcoming winter internship on
Geospatial fire prediction, which involves a heavy focus on LSTMs and RNNs. I understand these were foundational
technologies in NLP research before the advent of Transformer Architecture and provide a strong base to build upon over
Spring and Summer 2026. I also believe my strong background in mathematics and probability from courses in Linear Algebra,
Probability and Stochastic Processes, Differential Equation would allow me to contribute to your research in modelling these
complex linguistic structures.
```
```
My resume, which is attached for your review, provides further detail on my qualifications.
```
```
Thank you for your time and consideration. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss my application and your research
further. Do let me know if you want me to go through some particular papers end-to-end before the meet.
Warm regards,
Siddhant Agrawal
B.Tech and M.Tech in Computer Science, IIT Delhi
```
```
P.S. While the research highlighted above particularly caught my eye, I would also be interested in other projects surrounding
NLP: be it leveraging my experience with simulation and robotics or starting afresh from a new field. My desire to intern in NLP
stems from its large scale demand in Embodied systems in Robotics and in the booming LLM sector, and is not limited to work
on Vernacular languages.
```
### My Narrative & Motivations

```
My journey into computer science began with robotics, which led me to the conviction that the next fundamental
advancements in embodied systems would be driven by Natural Language Processing. My initial ML research experiences—
from an ISRO hackathon analyzing geospatial data to a project investigating the use of LLMs in academic peer review—have
solidified this interest while revealing the gap between theoretical knowledge and real-world problem-solving.
I am now motivated to pursue an NLP internship for two primary reasons. Mainly, I am drawn to the cutting-edge research at
the intersection of Embodied AI and the ongoing LLM revolution. Second, as an Indian, I am passionate about leveraging NLP to
make modern technology more accessible for our many vernacular languages, particularly in critical sectors like healthcare
and education. With my upcoming winter internship focused on sequence models like RNNs and LSTMs, I am preparing to build
the foundational skills necessary to contribute meaningfully to a research project.
